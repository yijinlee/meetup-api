    For geo-based requests, you may provide a location in one of three ways. By `lat` and `lon`, by `zip`, or by `country`, `city`, and optionally a `state`, if the provided country has states.

    Pagination works a little differently in this method than in others. Rather than using "offset" and "page" request parameters, this method uses an opaque "page_token" request parameter to determine the page of results returned. If there are more results, the "next" property of the [meta section](/meetup_api/docs/#meta) of the response will contain the next page's page_token. The number of results returned is not deterministic but a best-effort attempt will be made to return at least some.
